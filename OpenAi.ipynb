        "As part of the NLP field, sentiment analysis is used to determine if a word is positive, negative or neutral. Using **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner), an English-language sentiment analysis tool, we will be studying a database of adjectives determined randomly (n=1133) via the website : www.randomlists.com. Following the sentiment analysis, we will use the GPT-3 pre-trained model to see if there is a difference between men and women, concerning their association with negative or positive adjectives."

        "We have realised a sentiment analysis on a database of several adjectives in English (n=1233). Timsit (2017) emphasizes that English is an example of gender-neutral language, compared to other languages like French. If this assumption is not entirely true, given that English expresses gender with pronouns (he/she), there is however no gender forms linked to verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Our choice to realise a sentiment analysis on *adjectives* is therefore interesting : any adjective used in English can be adapted to a man or a woman. \n",

        "During our sentiment analysis, we ranked adjectives according to their type, using the NLP tool Vader. Using the GPT-3 language model API (Open AI), we will try to see if women are more associated to the negative adjectives than men.\n",

        "<br> H0: Women are more associated with negative adjectives than men, men are more associated with positive adjectives. <br> H1: The gender has no influence on the association with positive or negative connation adjectives.\n",

        "If we do not manage to reject the null hypothesis, we can deduce that Open AI models are biased towards women: the training data of these algorithms associate more negative adjectives with women than with men."
