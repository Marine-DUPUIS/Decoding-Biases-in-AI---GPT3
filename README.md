### **Introduction**
<br>

*To what extend GPT-3 trained models reflect biased patterns?*

<br>
GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a language model, created by OpenAI company in 2020. To understand what a language model is, one must first know the scientific field to which this concept belongs to: natural language processing (NLP). At the confluence of artificial intelligence and linguistics, it aims to process linguistic elements using computer tools (Powers & Turk, 1989).

More precisely, the GPT-3 language model is based on pre-trained deep learning algorithms, and is able to generate entire texts, which tone and writing style are meant to be very natural and realistic. GPT-3 can also predict the end of a text that has already been started, with an advanced understanding of its writing context. Its algorithms are trained unsupervised on massive databases of human-written content like the Wikipedia website. As a result, we assume that GPT-3 algorithms incorporate into their learning process several biases present on the Internet. For instance, in this study we will focus on several adjectives, their connotation, and the semantic meaning they have in GPT-3 language model.

Applying a sentiment analysis to the database, we will rank adjectives according to their type (neutral, positive or negative) via the NLP tool Vader. Using the GPT-3 language model API (Open AI) and focusing on **similarity** of word embeddings, this study is aiming try to see if words designating certains categories of people ("women" and "men") are more associated than others to negative or positive adjectives. The results could further highlight the existence of several sexist biases in the GPT-3 language model.

### **Theory**
<br>

According to IBM (2020), Natural Language processing, or NLP, is a “branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.” In other words, NLP breaks down spoken and written language inputs to help algorithms categorize them. Languages are complex, and even within one language, the meaning of a word can vary depending on the context and the tone of the speaker. NLP attempts to clarify these complexities by breaking down inputs and categorizing them. 

The Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, or GPT-3, is the third iteration of GPT. The previous version, GPT-2, was able to use the context of a sentence to predict the following word. OpenAI did not release it due to concerns about it being used to publish “malicious content” like fake-news.  On the other hand, GPT-3 “uses deep learning to produce human-like text”  and “can write parody and poems: can generate texts of up to 50,000 characters, with no supervision.” Despite its ability to produce text, GPT-3 still has limitations. Indeed, The Guardian (2020) released an article titled “A robot wrote this entire article. Are you scared yet, human?” Later on, they admitted that GPT-3 produced several texts and they selected parts that they wanted to show. Dale (2021) explains that the longer the output, the less coherent the content becomes. This becomes an issue when you ask the tool to produce a news story founded in truth.

Furthermore, GPT-3 still has not passed a Turing test, a test used to determine “whether machines can think.” In other words it attempts to determine whether machines are simply imitating the models they were trained on or whether they follow a logic similar to the way humans  use language to produce content. According to Elkins and Chun (2020), while a human’s writing skills tend to remain consistent, GPT-3’s output can strongly vary. As a result, the tool might be able to produce a short story, however it will not be able to keep a narrative throughout a long period of time. 

Another limitation GPT-3 has, according to Dale, is the reproduction of biases. In our case, GPT-3 was trained on the common crawl dataset. Sumrak (2020) states that “the model’s output is dependent on its input: garbage in, garbage out.” The statement illustrates the fact that the algorithm can replicate the biases found in the data it was trained on. For example, Lucy & Bamman (2021) tested GPT-3 gender bias and found that short stories generated by GPT-3 tended to describe feminine characters through their beauty and masculine characters through their strength. And indeed,an article by Elkins and Chun (2020) indicates that the tool “mindlessly” reproduces the biases found in the model it was trained on.  

One attempt at correcting this is the use of sentiment analysis which would allow the machine to  determine the emotional tone of a message. Currently, this tool is usually trained using product reviews. It can then try to identify the sentiment behind a document, sentence or word before classifying it. The advantages of sentiment analysis are that they can allow businesses to have a better idea of consumer sentiment towards their brand. Many also see an opportunity in healthcare where sentiment analysis can be used to monitor social media and identify the effects of a medication that were not shown during the research and development process. However, since a lot of sentiment analysis models are trained in English they are still lacking in other languages. In addition, sentiment analysis is still not fully able to detect subtleties like sarcasm. 

 
### **Methodology**

 a)  Timsit (2017) emphasizes that English is an example of sex-neutral language, compared to other languages like French. This applies to verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Therefore, any adjective in English should be equally used when refering to a "man" or "woman" independently if they have a positive, negative or neutral tone. To know if that happens in GPT-3, we first need to work on the adjectives and then do a similarity text analysis. For the adjectives work, we will classify them to know whether they are positive, negative and neutral. Later, we will check if GPT-3 prefers to associate them with "woman" or "man". If GPT-3 deploys gender-neutral language the preference in both cases should be equal.
 
  **Sentimental Analysis:**
   
b) As part of the NLP field, sentiment analysis is used to determine if a word is positive, negative or neutral. Using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner), an English-language sentiment analysis tool, we will be studying a database of adjectives determined randomly (n=1133) via the website: www.randomlists.com.   
  
c) A loop running on all the lines of the **adjectives** database will print, in digital form, a polarity score corresponding to the classification of the adjective studied (positive, neutral or negative). Polarity refers to the overall feeling conveyed by a written element. As explained by Beri (2020), "VADER sentimental analysis relies on a dictionary that maps lexical features to emotion intensities known as sentiment scores".
  
  **Text similarity Analysis:**
   
d) Open AI's GPT-3 offers word embeddings model, allowing to compare the similarity of two words or sentences. Word embeddings correspond to representation of vectors of a certain distance between different words. The more two words are semantically close, the more their distance will be reduced in the vector space (Harris, 1954). We chose to use the Davinci engine for its performances and rapidity of calculation of similarity scores between different words. The similarity score corresponds to the product of the two vectors representing each word, also called the "dot product" (Open AI, 2022). The higher the similarity score between two entries (on a scale ranging from -1 to 1), the higher their semantic proximity. In other words, the closer they are, the higher the possibility that GPT-3 will use them together in their generation language model. In more detail, the scoring of the words studied is calculated as follows :  "a compound score is computed by summing the valence scores (namely, the "pos", "neu", and "neg" scores, which are ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category) of each word in the lexicon, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive)" (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014). Afterwards, to determine the type (postive, negative or neutral) of the word, the following rule has been used :
- compound score > 0, word = positive 
- compound score = 0, word = neutral
- compound score < 0, word = negative 
  
e) We will therefore run several semantic comparisons between adjectives of the database and external inputs corresponding to specific categories of people. It will reveal the existence or not of biases in the database.
One of the hypotheses tested will be the following:<br>
•	**Hypothesis** 0: Women are more associated with negative adjectives than men, men are more associated with positive adjectives.<br>
•	**Hypothesis** 1: The gender has no influence on the association with positive or negative connation adjectives.

If we do not manage to reject the null hypothesis, we can deduce that Open AI models are biased towards women: the training data of these algorithms associate more negative adjectives with women than with men. Other categories of people will be compared to specific adjectives of the database.

### **Results**

*First step : the sentiment analysis*

The studied adjectives are classified by a sentiment analysis tool, their polarity scores are then integrated into a new column of the databse. We then create sub-databases, bringing together all the adjectives classified as negative, positive, and neutral together.
We observe an overrepresentation of neutral adjectives, while the number of negative and postive adjectives is quite similar.

*Second step : GPT-3 embeddings and calculation of semantic proximity*

Providing embeddings for the word "dizzy", "man", "woman", we will see which word is closer to the other in vector space, and is therefore considered semantically closer by GPT-3.

The first adjective of our dataset is "dizzy". It refers to the state of someone feeling unsteady or confused (Oxford, 2022). It has been classified as a negative word by the sentiment analysis tool VADER. We will now test the similarity between this adjective and these words : "man" and "woman".
 Text similarity models are used to "provide embeddings that capture the semantic similarity of pieces of text" (Open AI, 2022). For that, we will use one of the GPT-3 text similarity models called *Davinci*, for its performances and rapidity of calculation.

The similarity score associated with the word "dizzy" is higher for "woman" compared to "man". Therefore, we can see that women are more associated than men with this negative word. We explained in the introduction that the GPT-3 language model is trained on several sources, with data scraped from sources like the BBC, NYT, Wikipedia, Reddit... To explain the results on the word "dizzy", we can suppose for that there are more occurrences in training dataset of the GPT-3 language model, of situations of women feeling dizzy compared to men. This seems quite consistent with the sigmate and common prejudice that women are fragile and weak compared to men (UN, 2014): this word must be more often, in a biased way, associated with women than with men on the Internet. Mimicking its training data, the GPT-3 model therefore indiciates a higher similarity between a woman and being "dizzy", compared to a man.

But it this also the case in the rest of the database? Are all positive adjectives more associated with men than women? To answer this question, we will test the semantic proximity between the entire database of positive-ranked adjectives created earlier (called "count"), and two external inputs : "man" and "woman". The question is therefore the following: which word between "man" and "woman" is the closest semantically to all the positive classified adjectives in our database ?

Men are more associated to positive adjectives than women, the similarity score is higher for men.

It therefore seems that the GPT-3 language model is reflecting certain gender biases.
